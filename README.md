Welcome to my third tech-degree project: an interactive form. 
This project includes validation for name, email, and credit card fields. The validation dynamically produces errors and success feedback with visual aids, so users can correct the information provided while typing.
Form displays color shirts depending on the model selected, and payment type is also dynamically displayed.
